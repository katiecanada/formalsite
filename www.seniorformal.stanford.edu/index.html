			<h1>Q. What is included in the price of your ticket?</h1> 
			Two drink tickets for our full bar and hors d'oeuvres including sliders and cake pops, and of course great music, great venue, great friends! We’ll also have lots of fun activities during the night, including a photobooth, two dance floors, and live performances. 
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q. What is the attire for Senior Formal?</h1>
			This is a formal event. Women will most likely arrive in both short and long formal dresses, and men will most likely wear suits but this will vary as well.
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q. Are dates expected?</h1>
			Dates are not expected. Most people will attend formal in a group of friends, but of course some people will have dates. Feel free to ask a date to go with you, but it is by no means necessary or encouraged. Last year 1200 people attended senior formal, demonstrating that this event is about enjoying a special night with your friends and your class.
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q. What type of music will there be?</h1>
			Keep watching this space for DJ information! We will have a bit of everything, and a special music DJ will be giving a live performance.
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q.What are the details on transportation?</h1>
			Round-trip bus tickets from Stanford are $20, and can be bought online at seniorformal.stanford.edu. Buses will leave at between 8pm and 9pm and will return to Stanford from the venue between midnight and 1am. If you are staying the night, the Westin is within walking distance (< 1 block) from City View.

			There are a limited number of bus tickets so make sure you buy your tickets early. 
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q.I know two drink tickets are included in the ticket price, but what if I want to buy more?</h1>
			Extra drink tickets can be purchased online before the event at seniors.stanford.edu/formal. Each drink ticket costs $7. You will also be able to purchase extra drink tickets at the venue, but if you want to avoid the lines, we highly reccomend you purchase in advnace. There will be 6 full service bars, and they will all only accept drink tickets for payment.
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q. I have more questions! Who should I contact?</h1>
			As always, feel free to reach out to any of the Senior Class Presidents directly. We'd love to help you.
